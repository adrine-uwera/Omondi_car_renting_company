## Prompt: 

Omondi is starting a new business, a car renting business.

Omondi starts with five different Cars.

Each car has a model, a year when it was released, a year when Omondi acquired it, the money made from that car, the car's plate number, and the number of times that it has been in business. (It has been rented).

As Omondi is looking into expansion, he wants to be able to rent the cars, add new cars to his collection, remove the cars from his collection, count the number that each car has been rented out, and the money made from each car.

Please help Omondi.
